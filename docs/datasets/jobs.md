In SciCat so-called _jobs_ can be setup to interconnect to your local storage system to request a copy to a dedicated place for a certain period of time. A SciCat jobs description how to use the can be found [here]().

There used and still is the state of a dataset to be _archivable_. It will be seen if this kept or not. In case of questions please contact the SciCat [team](../about/index.md).
