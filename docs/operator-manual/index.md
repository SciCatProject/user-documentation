# Welcome to SciCat Operator's Manual

General manual for site-administrators can be found in the [**scicatlive**](https://www.scicatproject.org/scicatlive/latest/) documentation, it contains information how to set up and run a SciCat instance.

## Configuration of the Backend
There is one central place where one has a handle on how the Backend is configured in SciCat: the [dotenv](../backendconfig/index.md) file.

## Hands-on SciCat 
For getting familiar with SciCat's APIs, you can explore via the [Swagger](../swagger/index.md) interface.




Here we link to site-specific set ups.
